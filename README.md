This is the first time that I have experimented with html, CSS and javascript, I hope it can be useful to other beginners that would like to customise and format their own website. 

The home page 

1. Nav bar buttons
The nav bar that goes across the top of the page is detailed at the start of every html file. I selected 3 buttons; about, blog and contact. But this can be customised. 

2. Nav bar hover
The nav bar changes to blue if the mouse is hovering above this. This can be edited in the styl.css file. Additionally, the colour change happens over 0.5s which makes it appear smoother.
